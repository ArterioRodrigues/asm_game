# PONG

This is my first asm game, I am using youtube tutorials to learn. The goal of this project is to get the basics of asm down. I am using x86 for asm. Here is what I have learned, this game is created in the bootsector - (an area on all harddrives that the cpu checks for code to start OS.) The asm must end with 0x55aa to be seen as a bootable program.
