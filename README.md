# asm_game ðŸŽ®

This is project to build my "*asm*" skills by building a small game ðŸ˜‰. Hopefully it is small but I was recently on Youtube and saw videos on how game were made in the early days and how all were mainly made with "*asm*". Some examples I saw were DOOM and Rollercoster Typhoon. This is so cool and awesome it lead me to one quesiton how do you do it how would you make a game with just asm. This had lead me to this journey. In my head these are the steps I need to take
 * I already have some asm knowledge due to building some project for class in the pass but I'll need to brush up on my memory of it and probably decide if i want to use the x86 format.
 * Decide the type of game I want to make and what constraints come along with it for example I probably can't build a full blown pokemon or new games in this format the code would just be way to long. I am think either a snake or pong.
 * Start coding, I want to use as minimal help as possible **no tutorials** only google for functions, I want to try and be like those programmers in the day trying to figure out the code on my own with little resources.
